# Booking Service

The **Booking Service** is a Spring Boot microservice responsible for managing **court bookings** within sports arenas.  
It acts as the **orchestrator** between users and the **Court Service**, using **Kafka messaging** for asynchronous booking confirmation.

It is secured with **JWT authentication** and **role-based access control** for `ADMIN` and `CUSTOMER` users.
